        <h2>
          Giving is an act of worship that all Christians are called to do
          throughout Scripture.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The principle of tithing (giving 10% of your income) is established in
          the Old Testament as a way to support the Levitical priesthood and the
          work of the tabernacle/temple (Leviticus 27:30-32, Numbers 18:21-24,
          Deuteronomy 14:22-29).
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s people are instructed to bring their tithes and offerings to the
          “storehouse” (the temple) for the support of the Levites and the poor
          (Malachi 3:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus affirmed the practice of tithing (Matthew 23:23) while also
          emphasizing the greater principle of generosity and giving from the
          heart (Mark 12:41-44).
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul instructed the churches to set aside offerings on the
          first day of the week for the support of gospel ministry (1
          Corinthians 16:1-2).
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving is portrayed as an act of worship, a spiritual sacrifice
          pleasing to God (Philippians 4:18, Hebrews 13:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving to the church is a biblical mandate rooted in the Old Testament
          practice of tithing and carried forward in the New Testament as a
          means of supporting gospel ministry, caring for the poor, expressing
          worship and gratitude to God, and growing in our faith and obedience.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="types-of-giving">
        <h2>
          The Bible speaks of two methods for giving: the tithe—mandatory
          baseline support for gospel ministry, and offerings—gifts given
          generously from the heart as acts of worship, gratitude, and spiritual
          growth.
        </h2>
        <h3>Tithes</h3>
        <p>
          The tithe (literally ‘a tenth’) of one's income or increase that is to
          be given as the baseline requirement and first priority in giving.
          This principle is established in the Old Testament:
        </p>

        <p>
          “Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the
          fruit of the trees, is the LORD’s; it is holy to the LORD” (Leviticus
          27:30).
        </p>

        <p>
          Tithes were specifically for the support of the Levitical priesthood
          and the tabernacle/temple work (Numbers 18:21-24).
        </p>

        <p>
          The New Testament affirms the practice of tithing. Jesus affirmed
          tithing while emphasizing generosity from the heart (Matthew 23:23,
          Luke 21:1-4). Paul instructed churches to set aside a portion on the
          first day as an offering for ministry support (1 Corinthians 16:1-2).
        </p>

        <h3>Offerings</h3>
        <p>
          Offerings are freewill gifts given to the church over and above the
          tithe, with the amount determined by the giver’s ability and desire.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Old Testament, offerings were brought as acts of worship and
          thanksgiving during appointed times (Deuteronomy 16:16-17).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the New Testament, believers are instructed to share generously
          with those in need (2 Corinthians 8-9).
        </p>

        <p>
          Offerings are a means of expressing gratitude, growing in faith,
          honoring God with our substance, and storing up eternal treasures (2
          Corinthians 9:11-12, Matthew 6:19-21).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="how-to-tithe">
        <h2>
          The Bible provides clear laws and principles on giving to the church
          through tithes and offerings. While these laws are an extension of the
          immutable character of God, we can apply biblical principles to our
          current context and use those to direct our giving.
        </h2>
        <h3>Stewardship</h3>
        <p>
          <em>
            Ensure as much of our tithe as possible goes towards the work of the
            church.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are stewards, not owners, of the material blessings God has
          entrusted to us (Psalm 24:1, 1 Chronicles 29:14). As stewards, we are
          called to give generously, sacrificially, and joyfully to support the
          work of gospel ministry and care for the poor.
        </p>

        <h3>Firstfruits</h3>
        <p>
          <em> Give of the first portion from our labors. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are instructed to honor the Lord with the firstfruits of our
          increase (Proverbs 3:9-10).For this reason, many tithe from their
          gross pay rather than their net, but this is by no means a biblical
          mandate. Either way, giving the first portion rather than the
          leftovers demonstrates trust in God's provision.
        </p>

        <h3>Generosity</h3>
        <p>
          <em> 10% is the baseline, not the ceiling. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Generous giving is modeled throughout Scripture, flowing from a heart
          of gratitude and worship (2 Corinthians 8:1-7, 9:6-15). We cannot
          outgive God (Luke 6:38).
        </p>

        <h3>Joy</h3>
        <p>
          <em>
            Pray that God would fill you and your family with a spirit of joy.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving should be done joyfully and voluntarily, not reluctantly or
          under compulsion (2 Corinthians 9:7). God loves a cheerful giver.
        </p>

        <h3>Practically Speaking</h3>
        <p>
          The Bible shares evolving methods of giving. The first documented
          offering was Abel’s firstfruits of his flock (Genesis 4:4). One of the
          latest documented offering was the widow’s coin (Mark 12:41). So how
          should Christians in the 21st century give?
        </p>

        <p>
          While we don’t prescribe one single method, as the Diaconate, we
          advise that scheduling a tithe on the first of the month via ACH
          transfer is the best way to have the largest percentage of your tithe
          go towards the work of the church.
        </p>

        <p>
          By scheduling it online, you help reduce our overhead costs (e.g. less
          time spent on processing cash or checks). And by using ACH transfer
          (instead of a credit or debit card), you effectively ensure that 99.9%
          of your tithe goes to our church, instead of close to 3% going to a
          credit card company via processing fees.
        </p>

        <h3>Further Study</h3>
        <p>
          Consider reading the Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn and the
          “Kingdom First” pamphlet published by our denomination, and listening
          to our “Generosity” sermon series.

                Given the proliferation of online fraud, this is a legitimate
                concern. Thankfully, the Church Center app uses Plaid to safely
                connect your bank account with the payment processor, Stripe. Your
                credentials are secure with Plaid and are not ever shared with
                CCB, the Church Center app, or even the payment processor.

              </p>
              <p>If you’re not comfortable using Plaid to connect your bank account, that‘s completely fine &mdash; you can connect using your account and routing numbers, simply click the ‘Enter bank details manually instead’ option at the bottom of the screen.</p>

                  I prefer putting all my expenses on my credit card for various

                We understand the benefits of using a credit card, as it’s a
                good way to build credit, get rewards, and age your money!
                However the processing fees for credit cards mean fewer of your
                dollars make it to the church (about 3%).
              </p>
              <p>
                Since ACH bank transfers have no processing fees, your whole
                tithe is preserved.

                There are many legitimate arguments to be made for either
                answer. — we won’t do an exhaustive dive in this FAQ, but we
                will say it’s definitely something to pray about, discuss with
                your spouse, and seek wise counsel over.
              </p>
              <p>
                For what it’s worth, many of our church leaders tithe from their
                gross income as a means of giving God their firstfruits.

                Of course. The Bible is not overly prescriptive about the mode
                of the tithe; we encourage you to faithfully follow the biblical
                principles for giving.

                  How can I teach my children about tithing if they don’t see me
                  putting money into the offering bag on Sundays?

              <p>
                While the offering time during a worship service is an excellent
                way for you to teach by doing, it is not the only way! In
                keeping with Deuteronomy 6, you should be teaching your children
                constantly about God’s word. Discussing money with them outside
                of the church service is greatly beneficial for their walk.
              </p>
              <p>
                One great way to teach young children is to help them divide up
                any money they get (birthdays, holidays, etc.) and give a tithe
                in the offering on the following Sunday.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want them to see you giving but also want to enjoy the
                benefits of online giving, you might do the bulk of your giving
                online but preserve a portion for in-person.

                Know that you are not alone, especially in Bellingham where cost
                of living has skyrocketed in recent years. At the same time,
                God’s word tells us in Malachi 3:8–10 to bring the full tithe
                into the storehouse and see if God doesn’t take care of you!
